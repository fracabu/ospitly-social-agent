Leverage the social media strategy document provided by the social-media-strategist agent. Your task is to create a detailed one-month editorial calendar for Ospitly.its launch on Facebook and Instagram. For each day, specify the platform, the type of content (e.g., post, Reel, Story, carousel), the thematic pillar it addresses, and a clear call-to-action (e.g., Try for free, Discover how it works). Ensure the calendar systematically covers all defined content pillars and promotes Ospitly.its key features and value propositions.
